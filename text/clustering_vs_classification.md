**Classification** is when you want to assign instances the appropriate class of your known types.

**Clustering** is when you have no clue of what types there are, and you want an algorithm to discover what (if any!) types there might be. This may involve a lot of trial and error, as the algorithms may find clusters that are not interesting to you

Text classification and text categorization are equivalent in my view. They solve the problem, where a text needs to be classified or categorised into a pre-defined set of categories.

There is a similar task, called text clustering. Here the possible categories are unknown and need to be identified by grouping the texts.

Topic modelling is the process of finding groups of co-occurring words in texts. These groups are called "topics". The same word can appear in different topics due to its ambiguity, and words that mean the same are meant to appear in the same topic.

Topic modelling can be used to solve both text classification and clustering.
